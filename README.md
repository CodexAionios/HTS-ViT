# HTS-ViT: Hypergraph Tensor Supersystem for Vision Transformers

## Overview
HTS-ViT (Hypergraph Tensor Supersystem - Vision Transformer) is an advanced AI framework designed to optimize Vision Transformers (ViTs) using hypergraph-tensor representations and dynamic, self-optimizing computation paths. This project aims to bridge the gap between static GPU pipelines and evolving tensor structures, enabling efficient, adaptive computation.

## Vision
HTS-ViT is the software counterpart to GPU hardware acceleration, transforming AI processing units into adaptive, context-aware systems. This framework introduces hypergraph-tensor representation, self-optimizing data flow, and datatropisms as software-level optimization.

## Key Features
- **Hypergraph-Tensor Representation**: Encodes multi-scale image features and hierarchical relational learning.
- **Self-Optimizing Computation Paths**: Adapts computations dynamically based on input data.
- **Datatropisms**: Software-level optimizations for feature refinement and alignment.

## Why HTS-ViT?
- **Adaptive Feature Scaling**: Dynamically scales feature importance, avoiding unnecessary computations.
- **Hierarchical Representation Learning**: Connects related features dynamically, replacing rigid hierarchical layers.
- **Efficient Computation**: Replaces brute-force FLOP scaling with efficient, adaptive computation.

## The Future of AI Computation
HTS-ViT is not just another deep learning framework; it is the missing link in the GPU-software co-evolution. It paves the way for a future where software and hardware collaborate seamlessly to produce intelligence that is truly self-organizing, context-sensitive, and continuously evolving.
